# Hangman Game

A simple hangman game implemented in Python.

## Instructions

1. Update the word list to use the 'word_list' from `hangman_words.py`.
2. Import the logo from `hangman_art.py` and print it at the start of the game.
3. If the user has entered a letter they've already guessed, print the letter and let them know.
4. If the letter is not in the chosen word, print out the letter and let them know it's not in the word.
5. Import the stages from `hangman_art.py` and make the error go away.

## How to Play

1. A random word is chosen from the word list.
2. The player has 6 lives initially.
3. Guess a letter for the word.
4. If the guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
5. If the guessed letter is incorrect, the player loses a life.
6. Keep guessing letters until the word is completely revealed or all lives are lost.

## Usage

Run the script and follow the on-screen instructions.
